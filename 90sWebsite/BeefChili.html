      <p>This is the perfect fast fall/winter dinner. I only change the diced tomatoes to fire-roasted diced tomatoes. In the pictures above, I topped each bowl with a white cheddar cheese ghost that I cut from white cheddar cheese slices since this was Halloween dinner! Sometimes, if I have more time, I will double the recipe and add 1 lb. of beef stew meat instead of 2 lbs. ground beef. I will fry the beef stew meat until cooked. This CAN result in tougher pieces of beef. You can resolve this issue by then boiling the meat in beef broth to get the desired softness after frying it.</p>
