      <p>I found and altered this dish to fit my taste. It was requested many years ago that I make sweet potatoes for our holiday meals. I did not grow-up eating sweet potatoes and did not know how to cook them. I have tasted other people’s sweet potatoes in the paste but I just didn’t like them. I can only enjoy them as shown in this recipe. I add 1/4 ground cloves to add extra spice (I LOVE cloves!) And 1 tbsp of dark brown sugar for additional sweetness. As I stated on the homepage, holidays the diet goes completely out the window!</p>
